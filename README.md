IN PROGRESS: Redesign
IN PROGRESS: only show normal forces for trusses

To do:
- Allow units

DONE: Fix sig figs.
DONE: only allow member selection in solution mode
DONE: Fix intersections to count last 0 before non zero
DONE: do not allow overlaps in dist forces
DONE: create equations for data. Makes for better results.
DONE: fix distributed force display
DONE: position of forces for moments should be 0<x<100
DONE: centroid problem when area is 0. fix
DONE: Fixed AR on canvas
DONE: make sure the structures don't reverse on resize
